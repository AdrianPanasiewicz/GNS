Data logging: The system saves all received data for later analysis.
Mission Abort System: In case of flight anomalies, the GCS allows manual intervention to deploy emergency parachutes.
User-Friendly GUI: The application features a graphical user interface developed in C# using the .NET framework.

**Technology Stack**

Programming Language: C#
Framework: .NET
Communication: Real-time data communication with the rocket
